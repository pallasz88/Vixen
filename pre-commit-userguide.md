# Pre-commit User Guide
Pre-commit is a tool that helps you automatically check and fix code quality issues before you commit your changes. It can be easily integrated into your workflow and run on every commit.

# Installation
To use pre-commit, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can install pre-commit using pip:

`pip install pre-commit`

# Configuration
After installing pre-commit, you need to configure it for your project. The repository you're working on already contains a .pre-commit-config.yaml file, so you don't need to create one yourself.

To install the pre-commit hooks for your project, run the following command:

`pre-commit install`
This will create a pre-commit hook that runs the checks specified in your .pre-commit-config.yaml file on every commit.

# Usage
Once you've installed pre-commit and configured it for your project, you can start using it by making changes to your code and running git commit. This will automatically trigger the pre-commit hook, which will run the checks specified in your .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

If any of the checks fail, pre-commit will stop the commit from being created and report the errors that were found. You can then fix the errors and try committing again.

You can also run pre-commit manually on specific files or directories using the pre-commit run command. For example, to run pre-commit only on the files that have been modified since the last commit, you can run the following command:

`pre-commit run --files $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRTUXB HEAD)`
Updating pre-commit
To update pre-commit to the latest version, you can use pip:

`pip install --upgrade pre-commit`
Uninstalling pre-commit
If you no longer need to use pre-commit, you can uninstall it using pip:

`pip uninstall pre-commit`
